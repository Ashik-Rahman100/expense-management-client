# Expense Management

## project overview:

- Build a web application where users can easily input and keep track of their daily expenses in different categories. This app will assist users in managing their finances by organizing, summarizing, and setting limits on their spending. We've included some drawings of the user interface for you to check out. Take a look at the attached drawing at the bottom to get an idea of how the user interface will look!
